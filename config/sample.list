# Examples:
#
# A star at FITS coordinates (128.4,99.5) with magnitude 7.123 :
100 128.4 99.5 7.123
#
# A galaxy at FITS coordinates (102.0,180.7) with "total" magnitude 19.41,
# bulge-to-total ratio 0.42, bulge equivalent-radius 2.3 arcsec,
# projected bulge aspect ratio 0.8,
# bulge position angle 32.3 degrees (CCW, with respect to x axis),
# disk scale-length 4.0 arcsec, disk inclination (aspect ratio) 0.2, and
# disk position angle 31.3 degrees (CCW, with respect to x axis),

#
# A rasterized object at FITS coordinates (400.52,102.13) with magnitude 8.901,
index 42 (which points to the FITS image rasters/raster_000042.fits, the file-
name pattern can be changed with the RASTER_PATTERN configuration parameter),
size 5.4321 the original (with respect to the PSF sampling step), aspect ratio
0.999, and position angle 31.3 degrees (CCW, with respect to x axis):
300 400.52 102.13 8.901 42 5.4321 0.999 31.3
