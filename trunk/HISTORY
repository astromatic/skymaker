Jan 2007: version 3.1
        - fully parallelized
        - FFTs rely now on FFTW library.

Sep 2005: version 3.0
        - partially rewritten and repackaged version
        - support for external PSFs

Oct 99: version 2.3.3
        - copy of configuration parameters added in FITS headers

Sep 99: version 2.3.1
        - galaxy support improved; input file format changed for galaxies.

Sep 98: version 2.2.1
        - galaxy support added.

Aug 98: version 2.1.0
	- various portability issues solved.

Nov 96:	version 2.0 beta3
	- bugs in the simulation of asymetric PSFs and aureoles fixed.
	- optical aberrations added by P. Fouque, including spheric, astigmatism,
	  and coma.

Jul 96:	version 2.0 beta1
	- code TOTALLY rewritten.
	- now produces an accurate simulation of the PSF, using the diffraction
	  and seeing theories: mandatory for serious retina learning.
	- ``microscan'' mode for DeNIS J and K images.
	- jitter, tracking errors and defocus simulated.

Jul 95:	version 1.2
	- a few bugs corrected, but code is still ugly.

Feb 95:	version 1.1
	- K correction for Cousins B and R bands up to z=2.
	- produced several thousands of 512x512 images for training SExtractor's
	  neural network star/galaxy classifier.

Dec 93:	FIRST version 1.0 of SkyMaker
	- written in 2 weeks, to test the proto-SExtractor!!
 	- includes galaxies (K correction valid in Bj and Rf photographic bands).
